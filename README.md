# One life in one hour

this game is a experiment in i want chalenge my avilitys.

## Who run

[!] I recommend creating a local Python virtual environment.

```sh
python -m venv g_environment
source g_environment/bin/activate
```

[+] I recommend using our sh script for this.

```sh
chmod -R 775 run.sh
./run.sh
```

This sh script will create a virtual environment for you and automatically install the necessary dependencies.
